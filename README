This is a simple TCP communication program with simple GUI interface
I made this to practice what I leanred in a Distributed System subject
Although this may not have much to do with distributed system



*** What this does: ***
1.  there is a local [Server] class to create communication socket
    it also handles message forwarding sent by different clients

2. there is [ClientUI_1] or [ClientUI_2] showing interface for user to input username, IP address and pre-defined port
   [ClientUI_1] invokes [Client] class to establish connection with [Server] and send messages to server
   [Client] invokes [ClientThread] to handle receving message from other clients (forwarded by server)
   incoming and outgoing messages will be shown in the dialog, acting like a chatroom
   
   
*** How to run: ***
1. get the local IP address
2. run[ClientUI], add user name and add IP address to coresponding field and leave port number unchanged, click [click to connect]
3. type message and send
